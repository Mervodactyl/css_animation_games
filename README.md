Playing about with animations in CSS

Problems encountered/ biggest bugs in each self made exercise:

###Slider:
Don't forget the vendor prefixes, and if the file is large enough then @import the animantion for clarity

### Header:
Secret to the header is to make sure the file is not very large else 'jumps' occur during the animation sequence

### Spin_360:
Centering.... always a pain
